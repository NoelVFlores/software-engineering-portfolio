The primary task is Signature Recognition/Classification through the use of Siamese Neural Networks.

Goals:

* Given two signature images - the goal is to determine if they belong to the same individual (genuine) or are forgeries. This method 
is especially useful for fraud detection in banking and identity authentication.

* Create Custom CNN and compare the results against the Inception-v1 and Inception-v3 that were employed.
